# Creating-A-Movies-Database

# Business Problem
To produce a MySQL database on Movies from a subset of IMDB's publicly available dataset. Ultimately, the database will be used to analyze what makes a movie successful and provide recommendations to the stakeholder on how to make a successful movie.

The stakeholder only wants to include information for movies based on the following specifications:

- Include only movies that were released in the United States.
- Include only movies that were released 2000 - 2022 (startYear >=2000 and startYear<=2022)
- Include only full-length movies (titleType = "movie").
- Exclude movies that are missing genre or runtime.
- Include only fictional genres (where Genres does not include "Documentary".)
